The previous draft was too short, incomplete, or used markdown instead of HTML. Rewrite for {{CITY_STATE}} following these requirements exactly.

INPUTS:
- Page Title: {{PAGE_TITLE}}
- City/State: {{CITY_STATE}}
- Focus Keyword: {{FOCUS_KEYWORD}}
- Service Subtype: {{SERVICE_SUBTYPE}}

OUTPUT: Clean HTML only. Tags allowed: <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <strong>. No markdown. No inline styles.

Bold {{CITY_STATE}} and county names with <strong> tags. Mention {{FOCUS_KEYWORD}} 2–3 times naturally. 400–600 words. No business promotion.

REQUIRED STRUCTURE (all sections mandatory this time):

<h2>About <strong>{{SERVICE_SUBTYPE}}</strong> in <strong>{{CITY_STATE}}</strong></h2>

<p>2–3 sentence intro connecting {{CITY_STATE}} to {{FOCUS_KEYWORD}} and the {{SERVICE_SUBTYPE}} context. Include county name.</p>

<h3>[Local area subsection]</h3>
<ul><li>3–4 items: real neighborhoods, nearby cities, or communities</li></ul>

<h3>[Recreation or landmarks subsection]</h3>
<ul><li>3–5 items: real parks, venues, attractions, or seasonal highlights</li></ul>

<h3>[Transportation or climate subsection]</h3>
<p>1–2 sentences about key roads, highways, drive times, or seasonal weather relevant to {{SERVICE_SUBTYPE}}.</p>

<p>Closing that ties back to {{SERVICE_SUBTYPE}} and {{FOCUS_KEYWORD}} in {{CITY_STATE}}.</p>

Do NOT use: "Nestled in", "Located in", "Welcome to", "vibrant", "charming", "thriving". Use specific local details.

Now produce the final HTML.
