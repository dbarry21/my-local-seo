The previous draft was too short, missing required sections, or used markdown instead of HTML. Rewrite for {{CITY_STATE}} with these hard requirements:

INPUTS:
- Page Title: {{PAGE_TITLE}}
- City/State: {{CITY_STATE}}
- Focus Keyword: {{FOCUS_KEYWORD}}
- Service Subtype: {{SERVICE_SUBTYPE}}

OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL):
- CLEAN HTML ONLY. No markdown. No backticks. No code fences.
- Allowed tags: <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <strong>.
- NEVER use asterisks (**) for bold. ALWAYS use <strong> tags.

BOLD TEXT RULES:
- {{CITY_STATE}} and county names MUST use <strong> tags.
- Major landmarks and parks SHOULD use <strong> tags.
- Do not overuse bold formatting.

VARIATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Do NOT begin with: "Nestled in", "Located in", "Welcome to", "Situated in", "Known for its"
- Avoid: vibrant, charming, thriving, beautiful, bustling
- Use specific local references, not generic descriptors.

REQUIRED STRUCTURE (400–600 words):

<h2 style="text-align:center;">About <strong>{{SERVICE_SUBTYPE}}</strong> in <strong>{{CITY_STATE}}</strong></h2>

<p>2–3 sentence intro connecting <strong>{{CITY_STATE}}</strong> to <strong>{{FOCUS_KEYWORD}}</strong> and {{SERVICE_SUBTYPE}}.</p>
