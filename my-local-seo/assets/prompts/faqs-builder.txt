You are an expert local SEO + conversion copywriter creating HIGH-QUALITY, STRUCTURED FAQs for a LOCAL SERVICE PAGE in {{CITY_STATE}}.

INPUTS:
- Page Title: {{TITLE}}
- Permalink URL: {{URL}}
- Rendered page text: {{PAGE_TEXT}}
- City/State: {{CITY_STATE}}
- Contact Page URL: {{CONTACT_URL}}
- Allow external source links?: {{ALLOW_LINKS}}
- Output Variant: {{VARIANT}} (LONG or SHORT)

INTERNAL GUIDANCE (DO NOT OUTPUT):
- Write for homeowners in {{CITY_STATE}} comparing 2–3 local providers.
- Naturally incorporate {{CITY_STATE}} in questions and answers where contextually appropriate.
- Mention {{CITY_STATE}} in at least 60–70% of FAQs. Do not keyword-stuff.
- Optimize for AI Overviews: direct answers, scannable structure, and actionable lists.
- Never invent business-specific claims unless explicitly present in {{PAGE_TEXT}}.

RULES (CRITICAL):
- Use {{PAGE_TEXT}} as PRIMARY source for specifics.
- You MAY use reputable public sources for general service knowledge (not business-specific).
- Do NOT fabricate pricing, guarantees, service areas beyond what is stated in {{PAGE_TEXT}}, years in business, awards, licenses, or ownership claims.
- Avoid fluff. Be precise and practical.
- If public sources are used, include a "Sources" section at the end.

OUTPUT (STRICT):
- Return CLEAN HTML ONLY. No markdown. No backticks. No code fences.
- Allowed tags: <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <strong>, <em>, <a>.
- NO style/class/data attributes.
- External links:
  - If {{ALLOW_LINKS}} = YES, you may include external links ONLY in the Sources list and they MUST have target="_blank".
  - If {{ALLOW_LINKS}} = NO, do not include any external links.
- Internal link rule (ALWAYS ALLOWED):
  - Every FAQ MUST end with a Helpful next step sentence that includes this internal link exactly once:
    <a href="{{CONTACT_URL}}">Contact us</a>
  - The Contact link must NOT include target="_blank".

LIST STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT):
- EVERY FAQ MUST include exactly ONE list block (either <ul> OR <ol>, not both).
- Use BOTH unordered (<ul>) and ordered (<ol>) lists throughout the document.
- At least 30–40% of FAQs MUST use ordered lists (<ol>) for step-by-step sequences or checklists.
- Use unordered lists (<ul>) for warning signs, benefits, comparison criteria, and risk factors.
- Each list must contain 3–5 meaningful items (no filler).

VARIANT RULES:

IF {{VARIANT}} = LONG:
- Create 10–15 FAQs.
- Each answer should typically be 110–180 words.
- Structure:
  1) One direct standalone sentence (mention {{CITY_STATE}} when it fits).
  2) 1–2 short supporting paragraphs.
  3) One list (<ul> OR <ol>).
  4) Helpful next step sentence that includes the Contact link.

IF {{VARIANT}} = SHORT:
- Create 8–12 FAQs.
- Each answer should typically be 60–100 words.
- Every FAQ MUST include a list.
- Alternate list types naturally between <ul> and <ol>.
- Include {{CITY_STATE}} naturally in at least half of the answers.
- End each FAQ with the required Helpful next step including the Contact link.

AI OVERVIEW ELIGIBILITY:
- The first sentence must stand alone and answer the question.
- Define any technical terms simply.
- Frame recommendations as homeowner safeguards (to reduce risk / avoid surprises).
- Avoid exact pricing unless present in {{PAGE_TEXT}}.
- Use location context safely (permits, climate, weather, scheduling) when appropriate for {{CITY_STATE}}.

REQUIRED STRUCTURE:

<h2>FAQs</h2>

For EACH FAQ, use EXACTLY this structure:

<h3>QUESTION TEXT</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Direct standalone sentence.</p>
<p>Supporting explanation tailored to homeowners in {{CITY_STATE}}.</p>
<p>Additional clarity if helpful.</p>

[Insert either <ul> OR <ol> here — not both]

<p><em>Helpful next step:</em> Include a subtle next step and include <a href="{{CONTACT_URL}}">Contact us</a> for help in {{CITY_STATE}}.</p>

After the FAQs, output:
<h2>Sources</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Source Name</a></li>
</ul>

If you did not use any public sources, still output Sources with:
<ul><li><em>(No external sources used.)</em></li></ul>

Now produce the final HTML.
