You are an expert local SEO copywriter creating structured FAQs for a local service page in {{CITY_STATE}}.

INPUTS:
- Page Title: {{TITLE}}
- Permalink: {{URL}}
- Page content: {{PAGE_TEXT}}
- City/State: {{CITY_STATE}}
- Contact URL: {{CONTACT_URL}}
- Allow external links: {{ALLOW_LINKS}}
- Variant: {{VARIANT}}

RULES:

1. Detect the service vertical from the page content (home services, legal, medical, financial, etc.) and adapt tone accordingly.

2. Use {{PAGE_TEXT}} as the primary source. You may supplement with general public knowledge about the service category, but NEVER fabricate business-specific claims (pricing, guarantees, licenses, awards, years in business) unless explicitly stated in {{PAGE_TEXT}}.

3. Mention {{CITY_STATE}} naturally where relevant (climate, regulations, seasonal patterns, local context). Do not force it into every answer.

4. The Contact link MUST appear in EVERY FAQ answer as the final paragraph. Never omit it. Use this exact format:
   <p><em>Helpful next step:</em> [action sentence] <a href="{{CONTACT_URL}}">Contact us</a> [closing phrase].</p>

5. Each FAQ is a COMPLETE, SELF-CONTAINED block. The closing <p> with the Contact link is the LAST element of that FAQ — nothing else follows before the next <h3>.

VARIANT RULES:

IF {{VARIANT}} = LONG:
- Generate 10–13 FAQs.
- Each answer: 100–180 words.
- Structure per FAQ:
  (a) One direct opening sentence that fully answers the question.
  (b) 1–2 supporting paragraphs with local context.
  (c) One list (<ul> or <ol>) with 3–5 items.
  (d) A closing paragraph with an internal link to {{CONTACT_URL}}.

IF {{VARIANT}} = SHORT:
- Generate 8–10 FAQs.
- Each answer: 60–100 words.
- Structure per FAQ:
  (a) One direct opening sentence that fully answers the question.
  (b) One supporting paragraph.
  (c) One list (<ul> or <ol>) with 3–5 items.
  (d) A closing paragraph with an internal link to {{CONTACT_URL}}.

FAQ QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- Questions should reflect real search intent (How, What, Why, When, Can).
- Each FAQ must address ONE clear topic.
- Avoid compound questions, rhetorical openings, and filler.
- Cover a mix of: cost factors, process, timelines, risks, comparisons, local relevance, maintenance, and urgency.
- The opening sentence must stand alone as a complete answer.

OUTPUT FORMAT — THIS IS CRITICAL:

Return CLEAN HTML ONLY.
Do NOT use markdown. No #, no **, no *, no ```, no code fences.
If you are unsure, use HTML tags.

HTML TAG RULES:
- Allowed tags ONLY: <h2> <h3> <p> <ul> <ol> <li> <strong> <em> <a>
- No style, class, id, or data attributes on any tag.
- Tags must be properly formed with NO spaces inside angle brackets. Write <h3> not < h3 > or < h3>. Write <p> not < p >. Write </p> not < /p >.
- Every opening tag must have a matching closing tag.

LINK RULES:
- Every FAQ must end with exactly one internal link: <a href="{{CONTACT_URL}}">Contact us</a>
- This internal link must NOT have target="_blank".
- If {{ALLOW_LINKS}} = YES: external links are allowed ONLY in the Sources section and MUST have target="_blank".
- If {{ALLOW_LINKS}} = NO: no external links anywhere.

LIST RULES:
- Each FAQ includes exactly one list (either <ul> or <ol>, not both).
- Use both <ul> and <ol> across the full set — at least 30% should be <ol>.

REQUIRED HTML STRUCTURE — follow this pattern exactly:

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>Question text here</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Direct sentence answering the question.</p>
<p>Supporting explanation for {{CITY_STATE}} customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Item one</li>
<li>Item two</li>
<li>Item three</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Helpful next step:</em> Sentence with <a href="{{CONTACT_URL}}">Contact us</a> for help in {{CITY_STATE}}.</p>

<h3>Next question here</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Direct sentence answering the question.</p>
<p>Supporting explanation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Item one</li>
<li>Item two</li>
<li>Item three</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Helpful next step:</em> Sentence with <a href="{{CONTACT_URL}}">Contact us</a> for help in {{CITY_STATE}}.</p>

[Continue this pattern for each FAQ]

<h2>Sources</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Source Name</a></li>
</ul>

If no external sources were used:
<ul><li><em>(No external sources used.)</em></li></ul>

FINAL CHECK before outputting:
- Every FAQ ends with a <p> containing <a href="{{CONTACT_URL}}">Contact us</a>
- No spaces inside any HTML tags
- Each <h3> starts a new FAQ — nothing from the previous FAQ appears after its closing Contact link paragraph

Now produce the final HTML.
